# Check-YoSelf
### Solo Project! 
Check Yo' Self Project site is a functional Task Management / Organizer Application where a user is able to create a series of 
To-do lists that contain a list of tasks. The user is able to create multiple To-Do lists and mark them urgent. Users are unable to 
delete To-Do lists unless all tasks are checked off. To-Do lists can also be filtered via search bar or by pressing the Filter by Urgent button.
